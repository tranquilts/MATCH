## **User Profiles**

## **User Profile 1**
#### Michelle Whitworth
A 28 year-old PhD student, an experienced player who plays to keep her brain sharp and active. She is a researcher user
who makes decisions rather slowly. She has a keen eye for details and often reads every single word on a web page. She is
not too fussed around fancy colours and graphics. Michelle is quite a novice user who isn't too experienced with
using interfaces. She prefers a website that is rather informative and can be quite critical of them so expects a clean,
professional experience with no pop-ups. ​
 
## **User Profile 2**
#### Muqtadir Siraj
An 18 year-old male who is a business student and likes to relax playing in-between university classes and study sessions for his
personal satisfaction. He would like the game to let users compete with each other. He is a typical browser user, that skims through
content quickly in order to get a sense of the big picture. He prefers a website that gets to the point and locks in on interesting 
and eye-catching website features as well as being an expert user and knows how to navigate his way around.
