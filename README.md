## **User Profile 1**
#### Michelle Whitworth
A 60 year-old pensioner lady, an experienced player who plays to keep her brain sharp and active. She is a researcher user
who makes decisions rather slowly. She has a keen eye for details and often reads every single word on a web page. She is
not too fussed around fancy colours and graphics. Michelle is quite a novice user who isn't too experienced with
using interfaces.
 
## **User Profile 2**
#### Muqtadir Siraj
A 18 year-old boy, who likes to relax playing in-between university classes and study sessions for his personal satisfaction. 
He would like the game to be more inclusive for competitive gameplay with large groups. He is a typical browser user, that skims
through content quickly in order to get a sense of the big picture. He prefers a website that gets to the point and locks in
on interesting and eye-catching website features as well as being an expert user and knows how to navigate his way around.
